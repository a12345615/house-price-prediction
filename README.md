# house-price-prediction
📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The main notebook walks through the full workflow — from data exploration and feature engineering, to model training, evaluation, and final predictions.

# 🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and the features influencing house price.

Clean and preprocess the raw data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numeric data).

Engineer new features to enhance model performance (e.g., age of property, area per room, location encoding).

Train and compare multiple regression models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Evaluate model performance using metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²) and choose the best model.

Provide insights into the factors that most influence house pricing, helping stakeholders make better decisions.

# 🔍 Key Highlights

Overview of how features like number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age of the house affect pricing.

Visualization of relationships between key variables and the target (house price).

Comparison of model performance and discussion of trade-offs (e.g., complexity vs interpretability).

Deployment readiness: how the model can be used to make new predictions.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Primary programming language.

Key libraries:

pandas, numpy — for data manipulation.

matplotlib, seaborn — for data visualization.

scikit-learn — for machine learning (models, preprocessing, evaluation).

(Optional) xgboost, lightgbm — if advanced models used.
# 📈 Results & Insights

Best performing model: [Model Name]

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE: [value]

MAE: [value]

R² Score: [value]

Important features identified:

e.g., Age of house, Square footage, Location (zip/postal code), Number of bedrooms, Condition of house

Business implications: The analysis helps in pricing houses more accurately for sellers, identifying undervalued/overvalued properties, and supporting real-estate investment decisions.

Jupyter Notebook — For interactive analysis and documentation.

(Optional) Model saving/serialization: joblib or pickle.
